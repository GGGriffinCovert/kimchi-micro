# kimχ micro

kimχ micro is a small and spicy open hardware embedded SBC that offers tons of
versitility for many different applications.

# Features

## Application Processor

This project was undertaken with video encoding/decoding and wireless
connectivity in mind, so the i.MX8M Mini variant supports 1080p60 H.265 video
encode/decode.

## Mini PCIe

The board can host a half- or full-mini PCIe module as often used for high-power
wifi chipsets. Mini PCIe is also perfect for other types of wireless such as LTE
and LoRa radios.

## USB-C

The board has a full-featured USB-C port with power source and sink
capabilities, as well as support for battery charging and power.

## Expansion

To enable different applications, kimχ micro has high-density expansion
connectors and a standard add-on module specification, as well as a Qwiic
connector for rapid prototyping or simple sensor integration.

# Work in progress

This board is still a work in progress and is not yet considered production-
ready. If you wish to build this hardware yourself, expect that there may still
be some bugs.

# FAQ

## How do I pronounce kimχ

Like the spicy fermented cabbage (kimchi)

## Why did you call it that

So that when we make more of these boards, we can name them things like
saurkraut, sarmale, or cole slaw, and have a series of them called the cabbage
patch. But we really do love kimchi, and it has part of KiCad in it, and i.MX.
