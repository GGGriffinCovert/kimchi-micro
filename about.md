# GetLab

GroupGets is more than a platform democratizing access - we make stuff too. GetLab is our in-house team that conceptualized and delivered the custom accessories below for 3rd party products to enhance our backer's experiences and lower their technical barriers of entry.

Product development is in GetLab's DNA with each member having +15 years designing and shipping products for a wide spectrum of applications such as TrackR, HD surgical cameras, and PUREModules. When called upon, we also help our users get their own ideas to market. If you are ready for that journey, contact us.
