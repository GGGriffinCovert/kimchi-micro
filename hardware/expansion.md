## Avaiable Signals

This diagram is a placeholder. Most of these pins have multiple functions that will be documented soon.

## KiCAD template

A [KiCAD template for creating μLid expansion modules](https://github.com/groupgets/kimchi-micro-lid) is available on GitHub, along with some instructions on how to use it.

## Existing μLids

The following is a list of μLids that have been created:
