It has been a long time since updates here, but a lot has happened, and the
design has finally been brought up to fully functional.

Here are a few picture from assembly and rework:

The boards boot and all the components on the board have been checked out.

A few minor rework items are required for the v0.9 boards, and they are being
tracked on in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/groupgets/kimchi-micro/issues/1)
that links to details about the problems found.
